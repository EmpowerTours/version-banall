# Test Results and Protocol

## User Problem Statement
Fix 3D military mountain warfare game where marine characters aren't visually spawning despite game logic working. Marines should be visible, movable with WASD controls, and the UI should update properly after starting the game.

## Additional Requirements
- âœ… Web3 integration with Monad testnet (chainId: 10143) - IMPLEMENTED
- âœ… MetaMask and WalletConnect support - IMPLEMENTED  
- âœ… Entry fee payment (0.00001 MON) - IMPLEMENTED
- âœ… $TOURS token integration - PARTIAL (contract address configured)
- ðŸ”„ Bot AI simulation with pathfinding - PENDING
- ðŸ”„ Multisynq API integration for real-time sync - PENDING
- ðŸ”„ Large Mt Everest-style environment for 100+ players - IMPLEMENTED
- ðŸ”„ Telegram and Farcaster integration - EXISTING (needs enhancement)
- ðŸ”„ PostgreSQL database integration - EXISTING (needs enhancement)

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing Guidelines
- MUST test backend first using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
- Focus on API endpoints, WebSocket connections, and game logic
- Test marine spawning logic and game state management
- Verify database connections and third-party integrations

### Frontend Testing Guidelines
- ONLY test frontend if user explicitly requests it
- Use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` for UI testing
- Test 3D rendering, WASD controls, and game interactions
- Verify Web3 wallet connections and UI state updates

### Communication Protocol
- Always read and update this file before invoking testing agents
- Document all test results and findings
- Never edit the Testing Protocol section
- Follow minimum steps when editing this file

## Test History

### Backend Testing Results (2025-01-19 07:08:15)
**Testing Agent**: deep_testing_backend_v2
**Status**: âœ… ALL TESTS PASSED (9/9)

#### Core Backend Features Tested:
1. **Health Check Endpoint** âœ… PASSED
   - URL: `/api/health`
   - Response: `{"status": "healthy", "game_rooms": 1, "active_connections": 0}`
   - Confirms backend server is running and responsive

2. **Game State Management** âœ… PASSED
   - URL: `/api/game_state/main`
   - Response: Valid game room state with player tracking
   - Confirms game logic is properly initialized

3. **Static File Serving** âœ… PASSED
   - Root endpoint `/` serves banall.html correctly
   - `/public/game3d.html` loads with Web3 integration scripts
   - `/public/env.js` contains correct Monad testnet configuration
   - `/public/empowertours_logo.svg` serves properly

4. **Web3 Integration Configuration** âœ… VERIFIED
   - Monad testnet chainId: 10143 âœ…
   - RPC URL: https://rpc.ankr.com/monad_testnet âœ…
   - Contract addresses configured âœ…
   - WalletConnect project ID present âœ…
   - Entry fee: 0.00001 MON âœ…

5. **WebSocket Connectivity** âœ… PASSED
   - WebSocket endpoint `/ws/{player_id}` accepts connections
   - Receives expected messages: `player_joined`, `room_joined`
   - Player spawning logic working correctly
   - Game room creation and management functional

6. **Game Logic via WebSocket** âœ… PASSED
   - Position updates processed correctly
   - Chat message system functional
   - Marine spawning and tracking working
   - Room state management operational

#### Key Findings:
- **Backend server is fully operational** - All core endpoints responding correctly
- **WebSocket game logic is working** - Players can connect, spawn, move, and chat
- **Web3 integration is properly configured** - Monad testnet settings are correct
- **Static file serving is functional** - All game assets load properly
- **Marine spawning logic is implemented** - Backend correctly handles player creation and positioning

#### No Critical Issues Found:
- All API endpoints return expected responses
- WebSocket connections establish successfully
- Game state management is functional
- Web3 configuration is complete and correct

## Incorporate User Feedback
- Prioritize visual marine rendering fixes first
- Focus on smooth WASD controls with terrain collision
- Implement third-party integrations after core fixes are complete

## Backend Test Summary
**Status**: âœ… FULLY FUNCTIONAL
**Last Tested**: 2025-01-19 07:08:15
**Test Coverage**: 9/9 tests passed
**Critical Issues**: None found
**Recommendation**: Backend is ready for production use
