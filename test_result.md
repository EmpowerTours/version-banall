# Test Results and Protocol

## User Problem Statement
Fix 3D military mountain warfare game where marine characters aren't visually spawning despite game logic working. Marines should be visible, movable with WASD controls, and the UI should update properly after starting the game.

## Additional Requirements
- âœ… Web3 integration with Monad testnet (chainId: 10143) - IMPLEMENTED
- âœ… MetaMask and WalletConnect support - IMPLEMENTED  
- âœ… Entry fee payment (0.00001 MON) - IMPLEMENTED
- âœ… $TOURS token integration - PARTIAL (contract address configured)
- ðŸ”„ Bot AI simulation with pathfinding - PENDING
- ðŸ”„ Multisynq API integration for real-time sync - PENDING
- ðŸ”„ Large Mt Everest-style environment for 100+ players - IMPLEMENTED
- ðŸ”„ Telegram and Farcaster integration - EXISTING (needs enhancement)
- ðŸ”„ PostgreSQL database integration - EXISTING (needs enhancement)

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing Guidelines
- MUST test backend first using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
- Focus on API endpoints, WebSocket connections, and game logic
- Test marine spawning logic and game state management
- Verify database connections and third-party integrations

### Frontend Testing Guidelines
- ONLY test frontend if user explicitly requests it
- Use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` for UI testing
- Test 3D rendering, WASD controls, and game interactions
- Verify Web3 wallet connections and UI state updates

### Communication Protocol
- Always read and update this file before invoking testing agents
- Document all test results and findings
- Never edit the Testing Protocol section
- Follow minimum steps when editing this file

## Test History
*Test results will be documented here as they are performed*

## Incorporate User Feedback
- Prioritize visual marine rendering fixes first
- Focus on smooth WASD controls with terrain collision
- Implement third-party integrations after core fixes are complete
